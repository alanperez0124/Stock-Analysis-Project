# Stock-Analysis-Project

This project was completed with two other students that were enrolled in the Fundamentals of Data Science course. 
Our group decided to present on SPY and its relationship to general market movements because we believed it to be a good indicator of overall market trends. We chose this topic because during this time the stock market was starting to come down from the post-COVID rally that lasted from March of 2020 until January of 2022. 
We were curious as both students and investors as to what was contributing to this sudden shift in the market. Was it because of the mortgage rate hikes we were hearing about? Was it certain sectors underperforming? Could it be attributed to general market volatility? These were questions that we tried to answer in our analysis of SPY and its underlying holdings.
