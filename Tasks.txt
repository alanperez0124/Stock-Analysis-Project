### Task 1: Introduction to SPY

- Do some basic exploratory data analysis on SPY
- Create some basic plots about: The adjusted close price over time, the volume over time, etc.
- Maybe a histogram of daily return and what it means
- You can try to plot moving averages (i’m pretty sure pandas has something that can help, but I dont know if the professor would be cool with it)

### Task 2: The relationship between SPY and outside factors

- Basic exploratory analysis on VIX
	[x] Plot the adjusted price movement over the years.
	[x] Segway into the idea that they often move in opposite directions

- Will use the ^VIX and explore its relationship to SPY.
	[x] Plot the normalized Adjusted Close Price of SPY and ^VIX (Expect to see them move in 	    	      	    opposite directions)
	[] Plot correlation heatmap between SPY and ^VIX daily return (should see negative 	    	    		    correlation)
	[] Check to see if there is any relationship between volume of SPY and VIX adj close (this 
	    could be done by plotting the Volume of SPY vs VIX adj close OR by checking the 	    		    correlation heatmap)

- Check to see if SPY Adj Close is related to anything else: 
	[] Treasury values
	[] Average mortgage interest rates Bankrate.com or HSN.com


### Task 3: How SPY moves and why

- Since SPY is composed of several companies, you can see explore the relationship between those stocks and the movement of SPY. For example, from the website [SPY Holdings | SPDR® S&P 500 ETF Trust (ycharts.com)](https://ycharts.com/companies/SPY/holdings), we see that Apple comprises 6.93% of the weight. So, we would expect to see some strong correlation between apple and SPY.
- Anything else you can think of
